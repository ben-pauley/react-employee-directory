# React Employee Directory

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my employee directory application, developed using the React JavaScript library. The purpose of this application is to generate a list of employees with the assistance of the Random User API, with the ability to search for employees by name, and also sort details in ascending and descending order from the React application.

## Installation

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, with extensive use of the React JavaScript library via Node.js to create the front-end application, as well as the Random User API for generating employees.

## Conclusion

Developing my first React application was quite challenging but incredibly rewarding in terms of the satisfaction of completing stages of the application, but more importantly, in helping me understand how React works and how I can use it to my advantage when developing front-end applications.
